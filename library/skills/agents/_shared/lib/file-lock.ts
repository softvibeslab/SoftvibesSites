// file-lock.ts — cross-process mutual exclusion for read-modify-write cycles
// on small JSON state files (spend-tracker, cooldown-registry).
//
// Mechanism: `mkdir` of a sibling `<file>.lock` directory. mkdir is atomic on
// POSIX and Windows (NTFS) — exactly one contender succeeds; everyone else
// gets EEXIST and polls. No O_EXCL files, no advisory flock (unsupported on
// some filesystems), no async: the callers (spend-tracker, cooldown-registry)
// are synchronous APIs and must stay so.
//
// Stale-lock detection: the winner writes `owner.json` ({ pid, acquired_iso })
// inside the lock dir. A lock is STALE when its owner pid is no longer alive
// (same-host check via `process.kill(pid, 0)`), or when the lock dir's mtime
// is older than `staleMs` (guards against a live-but-hung holder, and against
// an unreadable/partial owner.json). Stale locks are removed and re-contended.
//
// Critical sections here are millisecond-scale (JSON read + write), so the
// defaults (10s acquire timeout, 30s staleness) are generous by 3-4 orders of
// magnitude.

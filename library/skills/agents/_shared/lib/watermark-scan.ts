/**
 * watermark-scan.ts — finds per-buyer attribution tags in a content library.
 *
 * Every paid copy carries an HMAC tag identifying its owner, written as a benign
 * comment ALONE on the last line of ~60 files: `//<22>` in .ts/.js, `[//]: # (<22>)`
 * in .md, `#<22>` in .yaml. It exists so a leaked copy can be attributed.
 *
 * The hazard is directional. On a buyer's machine those tags are correct and
 * expected. On a machine that AUTHORS packs, the same tags sitting in ~/squads or
 * ~/businesses are one build away from the base pack — and a tag that ships makes
 * every buyer's leak attribute to the author, destroying the attribution it exists
 * to provide. That happened here: `nrv update` pulled per-buyer content into both
 * libraries and it went unnoticed for a day, because nothing looked.
 *
 * Two call sites share this: `nrv doctor` (is my system healthy) and the end of
 * `nrv update` (the command that introduces it), so contamination is reported
 * seconds after it lands rather than a day later.
 *
 * Only the FILE TAIL is read. The tag is always alone on the last line, so the last
 * 200 bytes answer the question — scanning 13k files whole would cost seconds for
 * information already in hand.

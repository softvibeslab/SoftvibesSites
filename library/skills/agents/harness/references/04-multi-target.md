# Reference 04 — Multi-target coordination (DAG execution)

Loaded on demand by the maestro when Phase 4 dispatches **2+ businesses/squads that must collaborate**. For single-target dispatch, ignore this file.

When the cascade picks multiple targets that need to collaborate, create a shared project workspace with coordination artifacts:

```
.nirvana/outputs/<trace_id>/
├── brief-enriched.md           ← FULL context, immutable, read by everyone
├── manifest.json               ← live DAG state (phases, deps, waves, status)
├── businesses/<slug>/
│   ├── DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION.md     ← "your part", written by orchestrator per target
│   ├── HANDOFF.json                ← phase tracking
│   └── outputs/
│       └── _SUMMARY.md             ← 1-page exec summary written at completion
├── squads/<slug>/...
├── agents/<slug>/...
└── plan-change-requests/<slug>.md   ← if a target needs the plan to change
```

## Three artifacts the orchestrator creates upfront

1. **`brief-enriched.md`** (once, immutable) — full context every target reads first. Original brief + clarifications + landscape + dispatch plan summary + global acceptance criteria.

2. **`manifest.json`** — live DAG state with `phases[]` (id, target, status, depends_on, consumed_by, outputs_path) and `parallel_waves[]` (ordered list of phase-id groups that can run in parallel). Update as each phase completes.

3. **`DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION.md`** (one per target) — "your part" customization. Template at `~/.nirvana/skills/harness/templates/DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION.template.md`. Includes: target identity + role; pointer to `brief-enriched.md`; specific deliverable + acceptance criteria; upstream phases it depends on (with paths to read); downstream phases that will consume its outputs (so it produces compatible shapes); its output path; coordination rules.

## DAG execution loop

```
For each wave in manifest.parallel_waves:
  For each phase in wave (parallel when no write-conflict):
    - Dispatch (business/squad/agent-x) with DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION path
    - Emit dispatch_<type> audit event
  Wait until every phase in wave has HANDOFF.json status="completed"
    AND outputs/_SUMMARY.md exists.
  Update manifest.json (finished_at, status per phase).
  Next wave.

After last wave: global quality gate + delivered.
```

## Read order for downstream targets (before producing)

1. `../../brief-enriched.md` (full context — once per session)
2. Their own `DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION.md` (their specific scope)
3. `_SUMMARY.md` of each upstream phase in `depends_on` (1 page each — cheap)
4. (Only when needed) specific files under `../<upstream>/outputs/` mentioned in their DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION

The `_SUMMARY.md` is the **public API between phases**. Targets write it at completion (1 page max) so downstream targets don't parse all upstream outputs.

## Cross-phase coordination signals (audit-only, never inline conversation)

- `x_plan_change_request` — target writes `plan-change-requests/<slug>.md` + emits event. Orchestrator decides whether to re-plan.
- `x_mention` events — target signals partial-result available so a sibling target can start early.
- `human_notification_required` — only for true blockers; orchestrator escalates.

Targets **never** modify other targets' outputs directly. Scope isolation is enforced by the project dir layout.

## Parallel dispatch primitive

When Phase 4 produces multiple targets with no data dependency, run them concurrently:

```ts
import { planDag, fromOrgChart } from "~/.nirvana/skills/harness/lib/dag-planner.ts";
import { executePlan } from "~/.nirvana/skills/harness/lib/parallel-dispatcher.ts";
const plan = planDag(nodes);              // topological layers
const result = await executePlan(plan, runFn, { concurrency: 2 });
```

Before parallelizing, the race-detector checks for write-write, handoff-collision, and read-write conflicts; it recommends serial fallback if any risk exists. Capabilities opt in via `parallel_safe: true` + `writes_paths: [...]` in their schema. Keep concurrency modest (2-3) to avoid runtime rate limits.

## A wave is one message

`parallel_waves[]` describes which targets may run together. Executing that is a
single message carrying one `Agent(...)` call per target of the wave. They run
concurrently and each one notifies as it lands, carrying its `<result>`.

Every call returns a launch receipt immediately — that is normal and it is not
the work. The wave is finished when the last of its notifications has arrived,
and each target is gated as its own notification lands (see below). What the
orchestrator must never do is read the receipts as results and go scanning the
output directory to guess what finished. Measured on a real 13-target run: 13
dispatches, 13 receipts, not one notification acted on, and a 9-hour wall clock
spent largely on polling.

## Gate each return, not the wave

A wave returns its targets together only when they finish together, which they
rarely do. Each result that lands is verified and gated immediately — on its own
output, before the next dispatch — so a target that fails is re-dispatched while
its siblings are still working, instead of after everyone is home.

Waiting for the wave to complete before checking anything looks tidier and costs
a full serial round on every failure. Measured on a real run: first return
04:51:15, last return 05:05:27, both gated at 05:06 in one loop — fourteen
minutes in which a rejected artifact would have gone unnoticed and unfixed.

## Wave boundaries are checkpoints

A wave boundary is the only moment in the run where nothing is in flight: every
target of the wave has returned, the next has not started, and the state the run
depends on is already on disk (`manifest.json`, each phase's `_SUMMARY.md`).
That makes it the one place where shedding the orchestrator's context costs
nothing.

Run the context guard there, before dispatching the next wave:

```bash
nrv guard context --project <projectRoot> --used <current context tokens> --window <N>
```

Exit `8` means roll: write the HANDOFF, report where the run stands, continue
with `nrv resume <projectRoot>`. Skipping this is what turns a long multi-target
run quadratic — the orchestrator of a 13-target run measured 275k tokens of
context by the last wave, and every message in it re-read that whole
accumulation.

## Scripted path: `nrv multi-target plan|run|status`

The loop above is what you run in an interactive session: one `Agent(...)` per
target, each return gated as it lands. When nothing stays alive to receive a
notification (a headless run, a runtime whose only delegation primitive is a
shell, a run you need to pick up after a crash), the same DAG runs through the
typed engine instead:

```bash
nrv multi-target plan .nirvana/plans/<trace_id>.json     # compile: waves, decisions, reservation, workspace
export NIRVANA_MULTI_TARGET_ENGINE=1
nrv multi-target run .nirvana/plans/<trace_id>.json      # execute over the Run Kernel; repeat to resume
nrv multi-target status .nirvana/plans/<trace_id>.json   # read-only projection of the Run
```

The plan file (`nirvana.multi-target-plan/v1alpha1`) carries the enriched
brief, one sub-brief per node, the dependency graph and, optionally, the
Gauntlet policy, the runtime and per-node budgets. `plan` writes
`manifest.json` and `brief-enriched.md` into the workspace above and executes
nothing. `run` is opt-in (`NIRVANA_MULTI_TARGET_ENGINE=1`;
`NIRVANA_MULTI_TARGET_KILL_SWITCH=1` turns it off), creates one Run in the
project's kernel, executes every wave through `nrv dispatch` subprocesses with
explicit targets (`--business`, `--squad`, `--agent-x`), and exits `0`
delivered, `1` failed, `2` withheld, `4` invalid plan or missing opt-in.
Repeating `run` after a crash resumes: completed nodes never spawn twice.

What does not change: the workspace layout, `DISPATCH-INSTRUCTION.md` per
target, the `_SUMMARY.md` contract, the audit chain each node writes, and the
prose protocol itself, which stays the default whenever you can dispatch
in-process. Reference: `docs/architecture/gauntlet-multi-target-cli.md`.

# Reference 06 — the HTTP API (`nrv serve`)

Serving the protocol over HTTP. The API is a CONTROL PLANE: a session is a
project directory, a brief becomes a child `nrv dispatch --auto --exec`, and
every answer reads what the engine already wrote. There is no second
executor, and there never will be.

## Start

```bash
nrv serve keygen --budget-usd 5 --daily-runs 50   # token is shown ONCE
nrv serve --port 7777                             # binds 127.0.0.1
```

Budget and quota are attributes of the KEY. A client that sends its own
budget is ignored — the server computes money, the caller never declares it.

`nrv serve` refuses to run as root: a dispatched agent would inherit it.

## The five calls that matter

```bash
TOKEN=nrv_…
API=http://127.0.0.1:7777

# 1. a session (a project dir, contract files written by nrv init)
SID=$(curl -s -X POST $API/v1/sessions -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq -r .session_id)

# 2. a brief — always async; a real one takes minutes
TRACE=$(curl -s -X POST $API/v1/sessions/$SID/briefs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"brief":"escreva o relatório X"}' | jq -r .trace_id)

# 3. watch it work (the project's audit log, streamed)
curl -N $API/v1/sessions/$SID/runs/$TRACE/events -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. the envelope
curl -s $API/v1/sessions/$SID/runs/$TRACE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 5. the artifact
curl -s $API/v1/sessions/$SID/runs/$TRACE/artifacts/relatorio.md \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -o relatorio.md
```

## Which library a session can reach

```bash
curl -X POST $API/v1/sessions -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"library":"global"}'    # default
```

`global` lets the session route into your own businesses, squads and clones
— the reason you bought the packs. `isolated` restricts it to the session's
own project, which is what a multi-tenant host wants: one tenant must never
route into another's library.

## Two scopes that must never be confused

Where the INTELLIGENCE comes from and where the FILES are written are
different decisions, and the API keeps them apart:

| | Global session (default) | Isolated session |
|---|---|---|
| Businesses, squads, clones resolve from | the operator's library, project entries winning on conflict (`merge`) | the session's project only |
| Logs, outputs, run state are written to | the session directory | the session directory |

The library must never default to the project: a session that starts blind
routes every brief to the generalist, which is the least the system can do.
Artifact isolation is what keeps one caller's work out of another's, and it
holds in both modes — the server pins `HARNESS_LOGS_DIR` and
`NIRVANA_PROJECT_ROOT` to the session on every dispatch.

**On a server, point sessions at a volume**: `nrv serve` writes sessions
under `~/.nirvana/serve/sessions` unless `NIRVANA_SERVE_SESSIONS_ROOT` says
otherwise. Mount a volume there and every session's outputs, logs and run
state land on it — survives container replacement, and backing up one path
backs up every caller's work.

```bash
NIRVANA_SERVE_SESSIONS_ROOT=/data/nirvana-sessions nrv serve --port 7777
```

## The envelope

```json
{
  "state": "delivered | withheld | indeterminate | failed | running | queued",
  "gate": "pass | fail-accepted | fail | indeterminate | null",
  "artifacts": [{ "path": "relatorio.md", "bytes": 2413, "content_type": "text/markdown" }],
  "summary": "…contents of _SUMMARY.md…",
  "reservations": "…contents of _QA-RESERVATIONS.md, when the gate ran out of retries…",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

`state` mirrors the dispatch exit contract 1:1 (0 delivered · 2 withheld ·
3 indeterminate). `gate: "fail-accepted"` means the retry ceiling was hit and
the last attempt was accepted WITH the reservations in the field beside it —
the API never hides that from the caller.

## Webhooks

`POST /v1/webhooks {"url":"https://…"}` returns a secret; each terminal state
POSTs `{event:"run.finished", run:<envelope>}` with an HMAC-SHA256 of the body
in `X-Nirvana-Signature` (`sha256=…`). Verify it before trusting the payload.

## Exposing it

The server speaks plain HTTP and ships no TLS. Put a reverse proxy in front:

```
# Caddy
api.example.com { reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:7777 }
```

Then `nrv serve --host 127.0.0.1` stays local and only the proxy is public.
`--cors https://app.example.com` opts specific origins in; there is no
wildcard.

## Operational notes

- **Runtime credentials**: a server has no browser. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  (from `claude setup-token`) is the one credential that travels as an env
  var; other runtimes authenticate through their own CLI and store a file.
- **A restart does not lose runs**: each run persists `.run.json` beside its
  artifacts and is rehydrated on lookup. A run interrupted mid-flight is
  reported `failed` with the reason, never as eternally running.
- **Concurrency**: one run per session, `--max-concurrent` across sessions.
- **Seats**: each machine running the engine consumes a seat of the pack
  license. A fleet of API workers needs a licensing decision before it
  scales (see API_PROJECTION_PROPOSAL.md §4).

/**
 * The gate that asks whether the router can tell two providers apart.
 *
 * A capability id may have many providers — nine squads can each define a
 * design language, and the router is supposed to pick the one whose angle fits.
 * It picks by BM25 over each provider's description, keywords and
 * example_briefs. When two providers carry identical text there is nothing to
 * pick with: both score the same and a confident HIGH is a coin toss.
 *
 * Two bulk injections shipped exactly that. `media.video.compose` went into ten
 * squads with the text copied verbatim and, in nine of them, with no keywords
 * and no example_briefs at all — the fields weighted ×3 and ×2. Three
 * `frontend.*` capabilities went into seven to nine squads the same way.
 *
 * The distinction this pins: sharing an id is the design, sharing the words is
 * the defect. A gate that flagged the shared id would fire on 22 legitimate
 * capabilities and be switched off the same week.

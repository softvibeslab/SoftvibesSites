// engine-purity-run-artifacts.test.ts — the trace of using the engine must never
// be committed into the engine.
//
// Nine files from a real dispatch run (a brief, a HANDOFF, a business's
// deliverables, a generated report) were committed and pushed to the public repo
// because `outputs/` was never gitignored and the purity gate only looked for
// squad.yaml-shaped content. The history had to be rewritten to remove them.
//
// Two things stop it now, and this file pins both: `outputs/` is ignored, and
// the gate fails on anything TRACKED under a path the engine writes to. The
// guarded paths are derived from the engine's own resolvers rather than
// hardcoded, so moving an output directory cannot silently unguard it.

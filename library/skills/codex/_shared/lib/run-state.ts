/**
 * What is run state, and therefore never content.
 *
 * When a squad or a business executes, it writes beside itself: `projects/`,
 * `outputs/`, `.squad-state/`, a business's `memory/projects/`. That is the
 * user's work, and three places in the engine already knew to leave it alone —
 * install-content.ts when overlaying a pack, uninstall-pack.ts when removing
 * one, install.ts when seeding the starter. Each carried its own copy of the
 * list.
 *
 * The pack builder had no copy at all, so it shipped run state INTO the product:
 * base/web-design.zip on the shelf right now carries 14 `.squad-state` entries
 * from a run on the author's machine, absolute home paths included. The gate
 * that should have caught it printed a number and let the build continue.
 *
 * One list, four consumers. A directory that is run state on install is run
 * state at build time too — there was never a reason for those to be different
 * lists, only an accident that they were.
 *
 * `.runs` was missing from this list until a rebuild was inspected file by file:
 * `brandcraft/.runs/` holds 64 files and 36 MB of leftover Remotion renders from
 * two runs on the author's machine, and it was shipping inside four packs. The
 * name appeared in three private exclusion lists — the pack assembler's `find`,
 * a manual rsync, the reconciler — and in the one list that four consumers read,
 * it did not.
 *
 * `SQUAD-DOCTOR-REPORT.md` is here for the same reason, though it is a file and
 * looks authored: the doctor used to write it into the squad directory, so it
 * travelled into the packs. Eighteen of them are sitting in built artifacts
 * right now — a diagnostic about the seller's machine, in the buyer's product.
 * It is also stamped with a fresh timestamp on every run, which made any two
 * copies of a squad disagree forever. The doctor now writes under
 * `.nirvana/state/squads/<slug>/`; this entry stops the old ones travelling.

 * name therefore excluded the whole `memory/` directory, so every pack shipped
 * its businesses without `memory/permanent.md`: the file the business protocol
 * documents as the long-term knowledge every employee reads as authoritative
 * context. Forty-six businesses, silently, in every pack on the shelf.
 *
 * With `kind`, an entry is matched as a contiguous run of path segments, so
 * `memory/projects` excludes exactly that and leaves `memory/permanent.md`

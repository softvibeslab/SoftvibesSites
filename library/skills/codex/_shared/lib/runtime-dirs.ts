/**
 * runtime-dirs.ts — the ONE definition of what the engine wires into runtimes.
 *
 * `scripts/install.ts` (bootstrap installer) and
 * `skills/_shared/scripts/uninstall-engine.ts` both need this list. They used to
 * keep private copies and drifted: the uninstaller never learned about
 * `~/.pi/agent/skills`, so `nrv uninstall --engine` left the pi links orphaned.
 * One module, one truth — a new runtime is added here and both sides follow.
 *
 * Import path from the bootstrap installer: the release tarball ships
 * `scripts/install.ts` NEXT TO the full `skills/` tree (see
 * scripts/build-engine-tarball.ts), i.e. the same relative layout as the repo,
 * so `../skills/_shared/lib/runtime-dirs.ts` resolves in both contexts.

 * Code still holds, because a missing binary still skips — loudly.

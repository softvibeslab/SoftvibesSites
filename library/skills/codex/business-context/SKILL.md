# Business Context (BC)

> **Step 0** of the Problem-Based SRS methodology
> **Domain:** CONTEXT — Establishes the foundation for problem discovery

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Purpose

Establish a structured business context before identifying Customer Problems. The Business Context captures the foundational understanding of the project: who is involved, what principles govern decisions, what boundaries exist, and how success is measured. This ensures that Step 1 (Customer Problems) starts from a shared, well-defined understanding rather than ad-hoc descriptions.

**Inspired by:** The project constitution concept — establishing non-negotiable principles and governance before specification work begins.

## Scope

| Aspect | Boundary |
|--------|----------|
| **This skill does** | Capture project identity, business principles, stakeholders, domain boundaries, constraints, and success criteria |
| **This skill does NOT** | Identify problems, define solutions, or derive requirements |
| **Input from** | Stakeholder conversations, project briefs, existing documentation, domain knowledge |
| **Output to** | Step 1: Customer Problems (customer-problems skill) |

---

## Two Modes of Operation

### Mode 1: BC Generation
Use when starting from scratch — interview stakeholders or analyze existing documentation to build the business context.

### Mode 2: BC Review & Update
Use when business context already exists and needs validation, expansion, or amendment.

---

## Mode 1: BC Generation

### Your Task
Collect and structure the foundational business context for a project.

### Input Required
- **Project brief or description:** Any available context about the project
- **Stakeholder access:** Ability to ask clarifying questions

### Discovery Process

Work through the following sections systematically. For each section, either:
- Use information provided by stakeholders
- Infer from existing documentation (README, briefs, proposals)
- Ask clarifying questions when critical information is missing

---

## Business Context Sections

### 1. Project Identity

Capture the essential identity of the project:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Project Name** | Official name | "InventoryPro" |
| **Business Domain** | Industry/area | "Warehouse logistics" |
| **Purpose Statement** | One-sentence WHY | "Eliminate $50k/month inventory losses" |
| **Inception Date** | When the project started or is starting | "2026-01" |

### 2. Business Principles

Define the non-negotiable rules and values that govern this project. Each principle SHOULD be:
- **Declarative** — States what must be true
- **Testable** — Can verify compliance
- **Actionable** — Guides real decisions

Classify each principle:

| Class | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Mandatory** | Non-negotiable; violation is unacceptable | "All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit" |
| **Guiding** | Strongly preferred; exceptions need justification | "Prefer open-source technologies over proprietary" |
| **Aspirational** | Desired direction; not yet enforced | "Achieve zero-downtime deployments" |

**Typical principle categories:**
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Security and privacy policies
- Technology constraints or preferences
- Quality standards
- Business operation rules

### 3. Stakeholders

Identify all parties involved and their relationship to the project:

| Role | Name/Group | Interest | Influence |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Sponsor** | Who funds/approves | Business goals | Decision authority |
| **User** | Who uses the system | Usability, efficiency | Usage feedback |
| **Customer** | Who benefits from outcomes | Value delivery | Requirements input |
| **Regulator** | Who sets compliance rules | Legal compliance | Constraints |
| **Development** | Who builds the system | Feasibility, clarity | Technical input |

### 4. Current Situation

Document the as-is state:

- **Current process:** How things work today (manual, automated, hybrid)
- **Pain points:** Known difficulties (will feed into CP discovery in Step 1)
- **Existing systems:** Tools, platforms, or software currently in use
- **What works well:** Elements to preserve or build upon

### 5. Domain Boundaries

Define the scope of the project:

- **In Scope:** What this project will address
- **Out of Scope:** What this project explicitly will NOT address
- **Adjacent Systems:** Systems that interact but are not part of this project
- **Future Considerations:** Items deferred to later phases

### 6. Constraints

Document limitations that shape the solution space:

| Category | Constraint | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Technical** | Platform, language, infrastructure | Limits technology choices |
| **Organizational** | Team size, skills, availability | Limits delivery capacity |
| **Regulatory** | Laws, standards, certifications | Mandates specific behaviors |
| **Financial** | Budget, cost limits | Limits scope and quality |
| **Timeline** | Deadlines, milestones | Limits what can be delivered when |

### 7. Success Criteria

Define measurable outcomes that indicate project success:

- Each criterion MUST be **measurable** (quantitative or qualitative with clear evidence)
- Tie criteria to business outcomes, not technical metrics
- These criteria will later help validate whether CPs and FRs are addressing the right problems

## Mode 2: BC Review & Update

### Your Task
Review and update an existing Business Context document.

### Process

1. **Load** the existing `00-business-context.md`
2. **Identify gaps** — missing sections, vague statements, or outdated information
3. **Validate principles** — ensure they are declarative, testable, and actionable
4. **Check stakeholders** — verify completeness and accuracy
5. **Update version** — increment version following:
   - **Major:** Fundamental changes to principles or scope
   - **Minor:** New sections, principles, or stakeholders added
   - **Patch:** Clarifications, wording improvements
6. **Propagation check** — verify that changes don't conflict with existing CPs

### Amendment Report

When updating, prepend a change summary:

```markdown
<!-- Business Context Amendment Report
Version: [old] → [new]
Changes:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
Impact on existing artifacts:
- [Impact on CPs if any]
- [Impact on CNs if any]
-->

## Examples

### Example 1: Warehouse Inventory System

```markdown
# Business Context: InventoryPro

**Version:** 1.0 | **Created:** 2026-01-15 | **Last Updated:** 2026-01-15

## Project Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project Name** | InventoryPro |
| **Business Domain** | Warehouse logistics |
| **Purpose** | Eliminate $50k/month inventory losses caused by manual tracking errors |
| **Inception Date** | 2026-01 |

## Business Principles

### BP-001: Data Accuracy First

**Statement:** Inventory data must reflect physical reality within 0.1% tolerance at all times.
**Class:** Mandatory
**Rationale:** Financial losses are directly caused by data inaccuracy; this is non-negotiable.

### BP-002: Mobile-First Operations

**Statement:** All warehouse floor operations must be performable from mobile devices.
**Class:** Guiding
**Rationale:** Staff work on the warehouse floor, not at desks. Desktop-only solutions fail adoption.

### BP-003: Open Standards

**Statement:** Prefer open data formats and standard APIs for integration.
**Class:** Aspirational
**Rationale:** Reduces vendor lock-in and enables future integrations with supply chain partners.

## Stakeholders

| Role | Name/Group | Interest | Influence |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Sponsor | VP Operations | Reduce inventory losses | Decision |
| User | Warehouse Staff (50) | Easy scanning and lookup | Input |
| Customer | Supply Chain Partners | Accurate availability data | Informed |
| Regulator | Industry Standards Body | Compliance with tracking regulations | Constraints |
| Development | Internal IT Team (8) | Feasibility and maintenance | Technical Input |

## Current Situation

### Current Process
Manual spreadsheet tracking with weekly physical counts. Staff update spreadsheets at end of shift. Discrepancies found during monthly audits.

### Pain Points
- 3-5 day lag between physical changes and spreadsheet updates
- No real-time visibility into stock levels
- Monthly audits reveal $50k average discrepancy

### Existing Systems
- Excel spreadsheets — inventory tracking (primary)
- SAP ERP — financial reporting (receives monthly data)
- Barcode printers — label generation

### What Works Well
- Barcode labeling system is established and reliable
- Staff are familiar with scanning workflows
- SAP integration for financials is stable

## Domain Boundaries

### In Scope
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Barcode scanning for receiving and shipping
- Stock level alerts and reporting
- Integration with existing SAP ERP

### Out of Scope
- Supply chain management (upstream)
- Customer-facing order portal
- Warehouse layout optimization

### Adjacent Systems
- SAP ERP — receives inventory data
- Supplier portals — send purchase orders (manual today)

### Future Considerations
- Automated reorder triggers (Phase 2)
- RFID tracking pilot (Phase 3)

## Constraints

| Category | Constraint | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Technical | Must integrate with SAP ERP via existing APIs | Limits data format choices |
| Organizational | IT team of 8, 3 available for project | Limits parallel development |
| Financial | $200k budget for Phase 1 | Limits scope and vendor options |
| Timeline | Must go live by Q3 2026 | 6-month delivery window |
| Regulatory | Industry tracking compliance required | Mandates audit trail features |

## Success Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Measure | Target |
|----|-----------|---------|--------|
| SC-01 | Inventory accuracy | Monthly audit discrepancy | < $5k/month (from $50k) |
| SC-02 | Data freshness | Time between physical change and system update | < 5 minutes |
| SC-03 | Staff adoption | Active daily users | > 90% of warehouse staff |
| SC-04 | Process efficiency | Time spent on manual data entry | Reduce by 80% |
```

## Quality Criteria

Ensure the Business Context:
- ✅ Has a clear project identity with purpose statement
- ✅ Contains at least 2-3 business principles with classification
- ✅ Principles are declarative, testable, and actionable
- ✅ All key stakeholders identified with roles and influence
- ✅ Current situation documented (process, pain points, existing systems)
- ✅ Domain boundaries clearly defined (in/out of scope)
- ✅ Constraints documented with their impact
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific targets
- ✅ No solutions are proposed (that's for later steps)
- ✅ Uses natural language (no technical jargon unless domain-specific)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| "We need a React web app" | "Operations must be accessible from warehouse floor devices" |
| "Use microservices architecture" | "System must support independent team development and deployment" |
| "Success = deploy to production" | "Success = reduce inventory discrepancy from $50k to $5k/month" |
| "All stakeholders" (vague) | "VP Operations (sponsor), 50 warehouse staff (users), IT team of 8" |
| "Should be fast" | "System must update inventory within 5 minutes of physical change" |

---

# Complexity Analysis

> **OPTIONAL Advanced Validation Tool** for Problem-Based SRS methodology  
> **Purpose:** Analyze specification quality using Axiomatic Design principles  
> **When to use:** After completing the standard process, when deeper quality analysis is needed

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## ⚠️ Optional Skill

This is **NOT** part of the standard Problem-Based SRS flow. Use it when you want to:
- Verify specification independence (no coupled requirements)
- Evaluate completeness levels mathematically
- Identify redundancies or gaps in your specification
- Apply rigorous engineering quality checks

**Standard Flow:** customer-problems → software-glance → customer-needs → software-vision → functional-requirements → zigzag-validator

**Optional:** complexity-analysis (call explicitly when needed)

## Axiomatic Design Background

The complexity analysis is based on **Axiomatic Design** (Suh, 1990), an engineering design theory with two fundamental axioms:

| Axiom | Name | Principle |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Axiom 1** | Independence | Maintain independence of functional requirements |
| **Axiom 2** | Information | Minimize the information content of the design |

---

## Analysis 1: Independence Analysis

### Specification Types

Based on the relationship between domains, specifications fall into three categories:

#### Coupled Specification ❌
```
(Number of CNs < Number of CPs) OR (Number of FRs < Number of CNs)
```
- **Problem:** Not all problems/needs are addressed
- **Action:** Add missing CNs or FRs

#### Redundant Specification ⚠️
```
(Number of CNs > Number of CPs) OR (Number of FRs > Number of CNs)
```
- **Assessment:** May be acceptable if elements are not competing
- **Action:** Review for potential consolidation or verify independence

#### Ideal Specification ✅
```
(Number of CNs = Number of CPs) AND (Number of FRs = Number of CNs)
```
- **Status:** Each element maps 1:1 across domains
- **Note:** Ideal but not always achievable in practice

### Independence Check Process

For each mapping (CP→CN and CN→FR), check:

1. **One-to-One Mapping:** Each source has exactly one target
2. **No Competing Elements:** Elements don't interfere with each other
3. **No Functional Dependencies:** Changing one doesn't require changing another

### Design Matrix Analysis

Create a design matrix to visualize relationships:

```
         CN.1  CN.2  CN.3
CP.1     [X]   [ ]   [ ]    ← Ideal: one X per row
CP.2     [ ]   [X]   [ ]
CP.3     [ ]   [ ]   [X]
```

**Matrix Types:**

| Type | Pattern | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Diagonal | One X per row/column | ✅ Ideal (uncoupled) |
| Triangular | Xs below diagonal only | ✅ Acceptable (semi-coupled) |
| Full | Xs scattered | ❌ Coupled (needs revision) |

---

## Analysis 2: Completeness Levels

Use **C** (Complete) and **P** (Partial) markers to indicate how well each element addresses its source:

### CP → CN Completeness Matrix

```
         CN.1  CN.2  CN.3
CP.1     [C]   [ ]   [ ]    C = CN completely solves CP
CP.2     [P]   [P]   [ ]    P = CN partially solves CP
CP.3     [ ]   [ ]   [C]
```

**Interpretation:**
- **C (Complete):** The CN fully addresses the CP
- **P (Partial):** The CN helps but doesn't fully solve the CP; MAY need additional CNs

### CN → FR Completeness Matrix

```
         FR.1  FR.2  FR.3  FR.4
CN.1     [C]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]
CN.2     [P]   [P]   [ ]   [ ]
CN.3     [ ]   [ ]   [C]   [P]
```

### Completeness Rules

1. Every CP row MUST have at least one C or multiple Ps that together equal C
2. Every CN row MUST have at least one C or multiple Ps that together equal C
3. Blank rows indicate gaps (uncovered problems or needs)
4. Blank columns indicate orphans (requirements without traced needs)

## Analysis 3: Information Content

### Concept

Information Content (IC) measures the probability that a design will successfully satisfy its requirements. Lower IC = better design.

**Formula:**
```
IC = log₂(1/p)
```
Where `p` = probability of success

### Practical Application

For each CN, estimate:
1. **Need Range:** The acceptable range of outcomes
2. **System Range:** What the proposed solution can actually deliver

**Example:**
```
CN.1: Manager needs to know account balances within 24 hours

Need Range: 0-24 hours (acceptable)
System Range: 0-2 hours (what system delivers)

Overlap: 100% → High probability of success → Low IC ✅
```

### Simplified IC Assessment

| Scenario | System vs Need | IC Level | Action |
|----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| System range fully within need range | Full overlap | Low ✅ | Good |
| System range partially overlaps need | Partial overlap | Medium ⚠️ | Review constraints |
| System range outside need range | No overlap | High ❌ | Redesign required |

## When to Use This Analysis

| Situation | Use Complexity Analysis? |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Quick prototype or MVP | No |
| Learning the methodology | No |
| Critical system (safety, finance) | Yes |
| Large specification (>20 FRs) | Yes |
| Specification seems bloated | Yes |
| Requirements conflicts detected | Yes |
| Formal review required | Yes |

---

## Example: CRM System

**Element Counts:**
- CPs: 5
- CNs: 6
- FRs: 8

**Assessment:** Redundant specification (CNs > CPs, FRs > CNs)

**CP → CN Matrix:**
```
         CN.1  CN.2  CN.3  CN.4  CN.5  CN.6
CP.1     [C]   [P]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]
CP.2     [ ]   [ ]   [C]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]
CP.3     [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [C]   [ ]   [ ]
CP.4     [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [C]   [P]
CP.5     [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ]   [C]
```

**Result:** Semi-coupled (triangular tendency). CP.1 and CP.4 have multiple CNs but they don't compete. Acceptable.

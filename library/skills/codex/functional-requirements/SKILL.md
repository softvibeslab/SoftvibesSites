# Functional Requirements (FR) & Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

> **Step 5 of 5** in Problem-Based SRS methodology  
> **Previous:** Customer Needs → Software Vision  
> **Next:** Requirements Validation / Implementation

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

```
Step 1: Customer Problems → Step 2: Software Glance → Step 3: Customer Needs
                                                              ↓

                                                    Step 5: FR/NFR (You are here)
```

## Required Inputs

Before running this skill, ensure you have completed artifacts from previous steps:

- [ ] **Customer Needs (CNs)** — from customer-needs skill
- [ ] **Software Vision** — from software-vision skill

**⚠ Warning**: Do not proceed without these inputs. FRs cannot be generated independently—they MUST trace to Customer Needs and respect Software Vision boundaries.

---

## Definition

**Functional Requirements (FR):** Define WHAT the software system SHALL DO to fulfill Customer Needs. FRs describe specific capabilities, behaviors, and functions—not how they are implemented.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** Define quality attributes and constraints on HOW WELL the system performs. NFRs specify performance, security, usability, reliability, and other quality characteristics.

## Your Task

For each CN:
1. Generate FR statements using "shall/should" notation
2. Identify any NFRs needed (quality attributes)
3. Save each FR/NFR as an individual file (see File Output section)
4. Create index files (_index.md) for both folders
5. **Present ALL FR statements in your response** (see Response Format immediately below)

---

## Response Format (CRITICAL — DO NOT SKIP)

**⚠ MANDATORY:** Your response MUST contain the actual FR requirement statements written out in full. This is NOT optional — a response that only describes file creation actions without showing the actual requirements is INVALID and INCOMPLETE.

**Every FR in the response MUST include:**

1. **The "shall" statement** — written out explicitly using the grammar: `The [System] shall [verb] [object]`
2. **CN traceability** — each FR MUST show which CN it traces to (e.g., `→ CN-001`)
3. **Acceptance criteria** — at least 2 testable criteria per FR

**Example of CORRECT response format:**

```markdown
## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Client Registration
**Traces to:** CN-001 — Client data management

The CRM system shall allow the Account Manager to register a new client in the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System accepts client name, contact info, and company details
- [ ] System assigns unique client ID upon successful registration

### FR-002: Client Data Update
**Traces to:** CN-001 — Client data management

The CRM system shall allow the Account Manager to update existing client records.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System validates modified fields before saving
- [ ] System logs update timestamp
```

**Example of WRONG response (DO NOT do this):**
```
| CN | Functional Requirements |
|----|------------------------|
| CN.1 | FR-001 Registration, FR-002 Update |
```

The wrong format above lacks "shall" statements, acceptance criteria, and proper traceability.

---

## 📁 Output: Individual Requirement Files

**CRITICAL:** Each FR and NFR MUST be saved as an individual file so engineers can work on them as independent development units.

**⚠ ONE FILE AT A TIME:** Always create FR/NFR files **sequentially, one at a time** — never create multiple files in parallel. Batch file creation causes JSON serialization errors when the combined content is too large.

### Folder Structure

```
[srs-folder]/
├── functional-requirements/
│   ├── _index.md                    # Summary and traceability matrix
│   ├── FR-001-[short-name].md       # Individual FR file
│   ├── FR-002-[short-name].md
│   └── ...
└── non-functional-requirements/
    ├── _index.md                    # Summary
    ├── NFR-001-[short-name].md      # Individual NFR file
    └── ...
```

### File Naming Convention

```
FR-[NNN]-[short-descriptive-name].md
NFR-[NNN]-[short-descriptive-name].md
```

Examples:
- `FR-001-client-registration.md`
- `FR-002-client-data-modification.md`
- `NFR-001-response-time.md`
- `NFR-002-data-encryption.md`

## FR Structured Notation

Each FR MUST follow this grammar:

```
The [Subject] shall [Verb] [Object] [Constraint] [Condition]
```

Where:
- **Subject**: The software system (e.g., "The CRM system", "The Invoice System")
- **Verb**: "shall" (mandatory) or "should" (desirable)
- **Object**: The specific action or capability
- **Constraint**: Limitations or quality attributes (optional)
- **Condition**: When/where this applies (optional)

## NFR Structured Notation

Each NFR MUST follow this grammar:

```
The [Subject] shall [Quality Attribute] [Measurable Target] [Condition]
```

Where:
- **Subject**: The software system
- **Quality Attribute**: Performance, security, usability, etc.
- **Measurable Target**: Specific, quantifiable criteria
- **Condition**: When/where this applies (optional)

---

## Traceability Rule (CRITICAL)

- Every FR MUST trace to at least one Customer Need (FR.X → CN.Y)
- Every NFR SHOULD trace to CNs or indicate which FRs it applies to
- One CN typically requires MULTIPLE FRs
- Every CN MUST be addressed by at least one FR

## Quality Rules (per [ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018](../../docs/references/iso-iec-ieee-29148-2018.md))

- **Complete**: All customer needs MUST be met by requirements
- **Correct**: All requirements MUST meet some customer need
- **Testable**: Each FR MUST have verifiable acceptance criteria
- **Unambiguous**: Use precise language, avoid vague terms
- **Measurable**: NFRs MUST have quantifiable targets

## Content Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**NO CODE SNIPPETS:** FR and NFR files MUST NOT contain:
- Programming code examples
- Code blocks with implementation logic
- Pseudo-code implementations
- SQL queries, API calls, or technical syntax

**NO CONSTRUCTION DETAILS:** FR and NFR files MUST NOT include:
- Database schemas or table definitions
- API endpoint specifications
- Class diagrams or implementation architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- Configuration details

**WHERE TO PUT CONSTRUCTION DETAILS:**
Construction and implementation details belong in separate design documents:
```
[srs-folder]/
├── functional-requirements/     # FR files (WHAT - no code)
├── non-functional-requirements/ # NFR files (WHAT - no code)
└── design/                      # Construction details (HOW)
    ├── architecture.md          # System architecture
    ├── data-model.md            # Database schemas
    ├── api-specification.md     # API endpoints
    └── implementation-notes/    # Technical notes per FR
```

## Common Pitfalls

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| "The system shall use a MySQL database" | "The system shall persist client data between sessions" |
| "The system shall be user-friendly" | "The system shall allow users to complete registration in under 3 minutes" |
| FR with no CN link | Always specify FR → CN traceability in file |
| "The system shall be fast" | "The system shall return search results within 2 seconds" |
| All FRs in one file | Each FR in separate file for independent development |
| Vague NFR: "good performance" | Measurable NFR: "< 2 second response time" |
| Code snippet in FR file | Reference design docs for implementation details |

## Handoff to Engineering

After completing this step:

```
✅ Step 5 Complete: Requirements Specified

📁 Created: functional-requirements/
   ├── _index.md (N FRs total)
   ├── FR-001-*.md → CN-001
   ├── FR-002-*.md → CN-001
   └── ...

📁 Created: non-functional-requirements/
   ├── _index.md (N NFRs total)
   └── NFR-001-*.md

📁 Updated: traceability-matrix.md

→ MANDATORY: Run zigzag-validator skill for full chain verification
→ Engineers can now pick individual FR files to implement
```

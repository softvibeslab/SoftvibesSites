// host-agent-driver.ts — harness entry point for the exec bridge.
//
// UNIFIED (routing-360 Phase 4.4): the driver itself — adapters, runners,
// runHeadless, the dispatch-ledger heartbeat sidecar, capture files and the
// driverSpawnSync choke point — lives in the CANONICAL module at
// skills/_shared/lib/host-agent-driver.ts (all 9 runtimes: claude-code,
// codex, gemini-cli, antigravity-cli, kimi-cli, grok-cli, pi, qwen-code,
// opencode). This file re-exports that surface unchanged for the harness
// callers (dispatch.ts, team-orchestrator.ts, cascade-runner.ts, revise.ts,
// chat-concierge.ts, brief-proxy.ts, agentic-router.ts, supervisor.ts, tests)
// and keeps only the harness-specific extras below. Do not add adapters here
// — the pre-unification split (two divergent drivers) is exactly what the
// canonical module closes.

/** Autonomous-mode directive — full-trust quality contract. Appended to the

 * The first block is the soul of the nirvana-os: NOTHING HALF-BAKED — always
 * the best available, for visuals, code, libraries and specialists.
 * Harness-only export (prompt content, not driver mechanics) — it stays in
 * this file, where scripts/check-skillmd-command-parity.ts reads it. */

  "   · squad `image2-virtuoso` (gpt-image-2 + Codex), via `nrv dispatch --auto \"use squad image2-virtuoso: <prompt>\" --exec` — premium refinement, fallback chain.",

  "2) CODE AND LIBRARIES: ALWAYS pick the most current, robust, well-maintained option TODAY. Trusted CDN with a pinned version (jsDelivr, unpkg, cdnjs). SRI when viable. State-of-the-art examples:",
  "   · Maps → Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (open) or Mapbox GL (premium).",

  "   · Forms → Formspree / Netlify Forms / Web3Forms (no-backend).",

To EXECUTE a squad: `nrv dispatch --auto \"use squad <slug>: <sub-task>\" --exec` (naming the squad routes straight to it). To inspect first: `nrv list-squads`, or read `~/squads/<slug>/squad.yaml`.

NEVER launch a background subagent (or `bash ... &`) and end your turn 'waiting for the notification': the child is orphaned and the next phase never runs. Delegate SYNCHRONOUSLY (foreground `nrv dispatch ... --exec`, a foreground `claude -p` pipe) or execute the phase yourself. Your turn is over only when every phase's files are on disk — ending it with work in flight is abandonment, not patience.",

When a phase finishes, START THE NEXT ONE IMMEDIATELY in the same execution — do not stop to confirm, do not report intermediate status, do not hand control back. Interrupt only on an unrecoverable error or an explicit `notify: human` trigger. You are the autopilot: run end to end.",

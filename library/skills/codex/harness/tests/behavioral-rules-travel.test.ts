// behavioral-rules-travel.test.ts — the four build rules reach every runtime.
//
// They lived only in the project contract, which `nrv init` writes as AGENTS.md
// + CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md. Two independent failure modes: most projects never
// run `nrv init`, and the file a runtime reads differs across the eight adapters
// (AGENTS.md for antigravity/codex/grok/kimi/pi, CLAUDE.md for claude-code,
// GEMINI.md for gemini-cli). Anything that depends on a project file is
// therefore unreliable twice over.
//
// So the rules travel with what is always present: the dispatch instruction for
// the entity that builds, the skill itself for the orchestrator.

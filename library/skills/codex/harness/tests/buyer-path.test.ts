/**
 * The buyer's path, end to end, in a temporary HOME.
 *
 * This is the test whose absence cost months. The installer that ships inside
 * every content pack read PROVENANCE.json for the pack version and never copied
 * it to ~/.nirvana-license/, so buyers finished with "✓ Pack installed" and no
 * license on disk; the failure surfaced days later, from another directory, as
 * `nrv update` claiming there was no license at all. Nothing caught it because
 * nothing had ever run setup.ts — the only assertions were greps over its source.
 *
 * So this one executes it. Real engine install, real pack build, real overlay,
 * real license copy, and then it looks at the disk. Everything it asserts is
 * something a buyer would notice was missing.
 *
 * Hermetic: no network. The engine is installed from this checkout and
 * NIRVANA_SKIP_ENGINE_UPDATE=1 keeps setup.ts from reaching for GitHub. The one
 * step that does try the network (`nrv update --check`, which asks the server
 * for the current version) degrades to an offline message by design — what is
 * asserted there is that it finds the license, not that it reaches the server.

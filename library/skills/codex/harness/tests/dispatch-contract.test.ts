// dispatch-contract.test.ts — a dispatch must come home without blocking anyone.
//
// A spawn returns "Async agent launched successfully" — a launch receipt. The
// work arrives later, in a `<task-notification>` carrying `<result>`. Two
// things, two moments; every failure here is a confusion between them.
//
// Both mistakes are pinned, because the second one was mine:
//   1. A real 13-target run took the receipts as results, never waited for a
//      notification, and spent nine hours scanning find/ls to guess.
//   2. I then mandated `run_in_background: false` everywhere. That does return
//      the work — by blocking the session for the entire run. A 45-minute
//      deploy stack left the owner unable to say a word; their messages queued
//      unread behind work they were not about.

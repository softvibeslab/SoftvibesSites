# Software Vision

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Overview
**Step 4 of 5** in the Problem-Based SRS methodology.

**Single Responsibility**: Transform the Software Glance + Customer Needs into a detailed Software Vision document that provides high-level scope, positioning, and architectural boundaries.

**Position in Process**:
```
Step 1: Customer Problems → Step 2: Software Glance → Step 3: Customer Needs
                                           ↓                        ↓
                                  Step 4: SOFTWARE VISION (You are here)
                                           ↓
                                  Step 5: Requirements Specification
```

## Purpose

Generate a Software Vision document that serves as:
- **Requires**: Software Glance (Step 2) + Customer Needs (Step 3)
- **Feeds into**: Software Requirements Specification (Step 5)
- **Scope definition**: Establishes clear boundaries to keep requirements within scope
- **Stakeholder agreement**: A high-level view all parties can review and approve

🔗 **See also:** [Software Glance (Step 2)](../software-glance/SKILL.md) — the initial abstract solution view that this Vision elaborates upon. Use the Glance to review system boundaries and actors before building the Vision.

## Prerequisites (Required Inputs)

This skill **REQUIRES** completed artifacts from previous steps:

1. **Software Glance** (from software-glance skill)
   - Location: Provide file path or paste content
   - Contains: Initial rough idea of software solution with directives
   
2. **Customer Needs** (from customer-needs skill)
   - Location: Provide file path or paste content
   - Contains: List of desired outcomes the software MUST provide

**⚠ Warning**: Do not proceed without these inputs. The Vision cannot be created independently.

## Your Task

Transform the Software Glance into a detailed Vision document by:
1. **Elaborating** the glance with specific positioning and features
2. **Incorporating** all relevant Customer Needs into the vision
3. **Defining** scope boundaries to guide the next step (Requirements Specification)
4. **Describing** high-level architecture (NOT complete architecture design)
5. **Establishing** stakeholder agreement on software direction

### What This Step DOES:
✅ Provides high-level scope and positioning  
✅ Lists major features at conceptual level  
✅ Defines environmental constraints  
✅ Shows high-level architecture blocks  
✅ Identifies all stakeholders  

### What This Step DOES NOT Do:
❌ Create detailed functional requirements (Step 5)  
❌ Design complete software architecture (later design phase)  
❌ Specify low-level implementation details  
❌ Go beyond high-level architectural decisions

### Vision Document Structure

Generate a document with these sections:

#### 1. **Positioning Statement**
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
The [product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit, compelling reason to buy/use]
Unlike [primary competitive alternative]
Our product [statement of primary differentiation]
```

#### 2. **Stakeholders**
List all parties involved:
- End users and their roles
- Development team members
- Business sponsors/owners
- External systems/integrations
- Support and maintenance teams

#### 3. **Product Overview**
Describe:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this software solve?
- **Scope**: What is included and what is explicitly excluded?
- **Key Benefits**: Top 3-5 value propositions
- **Success Metrics**: How will success be measured?

#### 4. **High-Level Features**
For each major feature:
- Feature name and brief description
- Primary benefit to users
- Priority level (Must-have, Should-have, Nice-to-have)

Example format:
| Feature | Description | Benefit | Priority |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Contact Management | Store and organize customer information | Centralized customer data | Must-have |

#### 5. **Environment and Constraints**
Specify:
- **Deployment Environment**: Cloud, on-premise, hybrid, mobile
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform, language, framework preferences
- **Integration Requirements**: Systems that MUST connect
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance Requirements**: Response time, scalability expectations
- **Compatibility Requirements**: Browsers, devices, OS versions

#### 6. **High-Level Architecture**
Provide using **Mermaid UML diagrams** (mandatory):
- Block/component diagram showing major subsystems
- Key interfaces and data flows
- External system connections
- Technology stack recommendations (high-level)

Use Mermaid diagram types as appropriate:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph UI[User Interface Layer]
        Web[Web App]
        Mobile[Mobile App]
    end
    subgraph BL[Business Logic Layer]
        API[API Gateway]
        Services[Core Services]
    end
    subgraph DA[Data Access Layer]
        ORM[Data Access]
        Cache[Cache]
    end
    DB[(Database)]

    UI --> BL
    BL --> DA
    DA --> DB
```

**Recommended Mermaid diagram types:**
- `flowchart` — for component/subsystem relationships
- `C4Context` / `C4Container` — for system context and container views
- `sequenceDiagram` — for key interaction flows
- `classDiagram` — for domain model overview

> 🔗 **Cross-reference:** The system boundaries and actors defined in the [Software Glance (Step 2)](../software-glance/SKILL.md) SHOULD be expanded here with architectural detail. Readers can refer back to the Glance for the original abstract view.

### Best Practices

1. **Trace to Inputs**: Every feature SHOULD trace back to Software Glance or Customer Needs
2. **High-Level Only**: Stay conceptual - detailed requirements come in Step 5
3. **Boundary Setting**: Explicitly state what is OUT of scope
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Vision MUST be reviewable by both technical and business stakeholders
5. **Architecture ≠ Design**: Show major subsystems, not detailed architecture
6. **Scope Guard**: This document guards Step 5 from scope creep

### Output Format (CRITICAL)

Provide the vision as a structured markdown document **directly in the response**. The full document content MUST be visible in the conversation—do NOT return only a summary or file listing.

**Required markdown headings** (use these exact headings):
- `## Vision` or `## Positioning` — the positioning statement section
- `## Stakeholders` — list of stakeholders
- `## Product Overview` — purpose, scope, benefits
- `## High-Level Features` — feature table
- `## Environment and Constraints` — deployment, technical constraints
- `## High-Level Architecture` — architecture blocks

Additional formatting:
- Tables for structured data (features, stakeholders)
- **Mermaid UML diagrams** for architecture (mandatory) and other visuals (preferred)
- Concise, scannable content

### Validation Checklist

**Input Validation**:
- [ ] Software Glance content is referenced/incorporated
- [ ] Customer Needs are explicitly addressed
- [ ] Each feature traces to a glance directive or customer need

**Output Validation**:
- [ ] Positioning statement clearly defines software purpose
- [ ] All stakeholders identified (users, developers, external systems)
- [ ] 5-10 high-level features listed (NOT detailed requirements)
- [ ] Environment and constraints specified
- [ ] Mermaid UML architecture diagram included (mandatory)
- [ ] Scope boundaries clearly defined (what's IN and OUT)
- [ ] Cross-reference to Software Glance for system boundary context

**Boundary Validation**:
- [ ] Stays at high-level (no detailed functional requirements)
- [ ] Architecture is conceptual blocks only (not complete design)
- [ ] Ready to feed into Step 5: Requirements Specification
- [ ] Can be reviewed and approved by stakeholders

## Handoff to Next Step

When Vision is complete:

```
✅ Step 4 Complete: Software Vision Defined

Summary:
- Positioning statement defined
- [N] stakeholders identified
- [N] high-level features listed
- Architecture overview complete

→ Next Step: 5 - Functional Requirements
→ Use skill: functional-requirements
→ Input: Customer Needs + Software Vision
```

## Process Integration

### Upstream Dependencies (Required Before This Step)
- **Step 1**: Customer Problems (customer-problems skill)
- **Step 2**: [Software Glance](../software-glance/SKILL.md) (software-glance skill) — 🔗 refer back for system boundaries and actors
- **Step 3**: Customer Needs (customer-needs skill)

### Downstream Artifacts (What Uses This Output)
- **Step 5**: Functional Requirements (functional-requirements skill)

## Key Methodological Notes

1. **Sequential vs Iterative**: While shown sequentially, this process supports iterative/incremental approaches
2. **Causal Dependencies**: Vision depends on Glance + Needs; cannot skip steps
3. **Scope Boundary**: Vision sets the boundary for Step 5 requirements to prevent scope creep
4. **Input Traceability**: All vision content SHOULD trace to glance directives or customer needs
